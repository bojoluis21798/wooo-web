                      <ChapterListItem>You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.</ChapterListItem>
                      <ChapterListItem>
                        In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include:

                        </ul>
                        However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
                      </ChapterListItem>
                      <ChapterListItem>
                        In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are:
                        <ul className="list">
                          <ChapterListItem>you contest the accuracy of the personal data;</ChapterListItem>
                          <ChapterListItem>processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure;</ChapterListItem>
                          <ChapterListItem>we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and</ChapterListItem>

                        Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.
                      </ChapterListItem>
                      <ChapterListItem>You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</ChapterListItem>
                      <ChapterListItem>You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes).

                      <ChapterListItem>
                        To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is:

                        and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
